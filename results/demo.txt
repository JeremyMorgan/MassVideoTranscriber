 Hi, Jeremy Morgan here. And this is a Python script to extract the audio from a video and then transcribe that audio using the Whisper API. So you need the Whisper API installed because this is actually doing it on your local machine. And you need FFM Pag installed. But this script will do all of this on your local machine and not only will it do it for one video, but you can take a batch of videos, a whole bunch of them, put them in the videos folder and it will go through each of those videos, extract the audio, transcribe it into a text file with a separate text file for each video. And it does it all locally. No external services needed at all. So if you like this kind of thing, use the script for whatever you want and give my GitHub repo a star.
